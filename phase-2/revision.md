# Revision

\+ **1.** Summary of project phase 1.
In the project phase 1, based on the customer's needs, we completed the preliminary analysis. First of all, we watched the video, and introduced it to every group member to make sure they know what we should do. The second step listed the functional requirements and non-functional requirements and identified the actors. Then, based on the requirements, we drew the use case diagram and data flow diagram. Besides, we have done a work breakdown structure form to divide the work into each group members to do their own work.
